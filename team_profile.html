								<h2>Grant Nicholas - ID: S3954897</h2>
								<p>
									My love of fishing prompted a friend and I to begin our own startup company and releasing a Mobile Application called “iDfish” that has been live on the Apple’s App Store and Google Play for the last 6 years.
									I am also an avid cross country mountain biker.
									I ride local trails around the Brisbane area for fitness and fun.
									I have been working with electronic systems, automation and control systems and the IT industry in various capacities for the past 30 plus years.
									It is my involvement with iDfish that has prompted be to further my knowledge by getting a Bachelor of information Technology at RMIT.
									My ideal job is a requirement for my own business and my initial focus was a Mobile app developer.
									With the expansion of my knowledge through this course my ideal job has now changed to a full stack developer with a database, mobile application flavour.

								<h2>Maritza Molina - ID: S3956706</h2>
								<p>
									My professional background began in Finance after completing a Diploma in Bookkeeping and Accounting after I graduated High School.
									Technology was a non-consequential part of my occupation as the focus was always process and accuracy.
									A break in-between jobs resulted in me being recruited for a temporary contract role within Queensland Health during what has been described as the worst Payroll Software Rollout in history.
									Witnessing the “Payroll Debacle” firsthand, gave me a unique opportunity to see the impact of a poorly configured software rollout forced onto an unsuspecting and untrained end user.
									I stayed on for 5 years as part of the improvement process and assisted in their now BAU (business as usual) process.
									I have since been passionate about the HRIS Systems and their need to be the seamless conduit within a fortnightly transaction, specifically SAP as a company.
									My ideal job has not changed through this course and my plan to complete this degree remains a key cornerstone to my success in the future.

									<h2>Grant Nicholas</h2>
									<p>
										As a Diplomat with the People Mastery strategy, Grant fits well into the role of group leader.
										Diplomats prioritise communication and connecting with others; and those with the People Mastery strategy are particularly capable of stress management and maintaining their confidence.
										With the combination of seeking out connections, maintaining confidence, and comfortably leading in social situations, it is no surprise he has been chosen for the role of group leader.

								</div>
								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>Maritza Molina</h2>
									<p>
										A Diplomat with the Social Engagement strategy can be trusted to speak their mind and feel at home in social settings, caring deeply about the levels of communication within a group and more than prepared to reach out and make connections.
										With Maritza’s outstanding social confidence, she is the perfect choice for organising our IT professional interview and can be relied upon to be well involved in our meetings, keeping everyone up to date on her progress.

								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>James Falla</h2>
									<p>
										Sentinels are known for their confidence, co-operation, and grounded nature, working hard to maintain stability and steady progress, and carefully ensuring that all goes smoothly.
										That in combination with the Confident Individualism strategy paints a picture of someone who is self-motivated, efficient, and will fix anything he can when he sees the opportunity to do so.
										James has quickly proven himself to be a valuable member of the team, exhibiting these qualities and more.
										He knows his strengths and will use them wherever possible, doing what he can to ensure we get the job done.

							<h2>Group Process</h2>
								<p>In Assignment 2, the group was newly formed and still learning the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, with all that considered, we worked incredibly well and put together an amazing Assignment 2. The main change from Assignment 2 to Assignment 3 will be that 2 members have pulled out at the last minute, but the remaining 3 members have pulled together, evenly divided the unaccounted work that needs to be completed and created what is another amazing assignment in Assignment 3. </p>
							<h2>Career Plans</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2022-05-27 at 11.03.57 pm.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Developers. Given the small size of our team, it was more beneficial for the team to work together and complete the tasks required irrespective of what their roles might have been. </p>
