								<h2>Grant Nicholas - ID: S3954897</h2>
								<p>
									My love of fishing prompted a friend and I to begin our own startup company and releasing a Mobile Application called “iDfish” that has been live on the Apple’s App Store and Google Play for the last 6 years.
									I am also an avid cross country mountain biker.
									I ride local trails around the Brisbane area for fitness and fun.
									I have been working with electronic systems, automation and control systems and the IT industry in various capacities for the past 30 plus years.
									It is my involvement with iDfish that has prompted be to further my knowledge by getting a Bachelor of information Technology at RMIT.
									My ideal job is a requirement for my own business and my initial focus was a Mobile app developer.
									With the expansion of my knowledge through this course my ideal job has now changed to a full stack developer with a database, mobile application flavour.

								<h2>William Prebendarcik - ID: S3912780</h2>
								<p>
									I have had an interest in IT for most of my life.
									I was lucky to have owned an ATARI 2600, purchased in 1983.
									The Commodore 64 arrived on the scene three years later; I had a plan to learn C64 BASIC which never eventuated.
									A lost opportunity, and one of many. The Amiga 500 came a couple of years later, followed by a few iterations of PC clones.
									As much as I had wanted to “get into” programming, I never did. Now I’m finally studying at RMIT. I still enjoy gaming (on a PC), reading, and occasionally doing some exercise, whether weights or cardio. 
								</p>

								<h2>Maritza Molina - ID: S3956706</h2>
								<p>
									My professional background began in Finance after completing a Diploma in Bookkeeping and Accounting after I graduated High School.
									Technology was a non-consequential part of my occupation as the focus was always process and accuracy.
									A break in-between jobs resulted in me being recruited for a temporary contract role within Queensland Health during what has been described as the worst Payroll Software Rollout in history.
									Witnessing the “Payroll Debacle” firsthand, gave me a unique opportunity to see the impact of a poorly configured software rollout forced onto an unsuspecting and untrained end user.
									I stayed on for 5 years as part of the improvement process and assisted in their now BAU (business as usual) process.
									I have since been passionate about the HRIS Systems and their need to be the seamless conduit within a fortnightly transaction, specifically SAP as a company.
									My ideal job has not changed through this course and my plan to complete this degree remains a key cornerstone to my success in the future.

								<h2>James Falla - ID: S3956749</h2>
								<p>
									My name is James Falla (student number: S3956749) a team member of LevelUp! .
									My hobbies include playing tennis, video games and painting miniatures.
									My IT interest came from when I built my first PC and slowly discovering the world of IT around it.
									Now I currently work for FYB Pty Ltd where I work on the support desk assisting various customers with the application Content Manager.

								<h2>Stephen Lincoln - ID: S3955566</h2>
								<p>
									Since high school I have studied bits and pieces from a variety of subjects including IT, Accounting, Cyber Security, and a bit of Psychology.
									My highest qualification thus far is my Certificate IV in Accounting and Bookkeeping.
									During my downtime I have been known to enjoy strategy games and occasionally take part in trading card tournaments; though I spend just as much time on analysis and strategy developmnent as I do with the games themselves.
									Computing technology has always fascinated me, and since realising how well my strengths align with the work of the IT industry, I have been trying to carve my path to a career in the field.
									My ideal job would be to work as a Machine Learning Engineer, specifically focusing on Natural Language Processing if possible.
									After our industry analysis I see that I may have to consider an alternate, more attainable career goal.

									<h2>Grant Nicholas</h2>
									<p>
										As a Diplomat with the People Mastery strategy, Grant fits well into the role of group leader.
										Diplomats prioritise communication and connecting with others; and those with the People Mastery strategy are particularly capable of stress management and maintaining their confidence.
										With the combination of seeking out connections, maintaining confidence, and comfortably leading in social situations, it is no surprise he has been chosen for the role of group leader.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>William Prebendarcik</h2>
									<p>
										Even though William was our second pick for team leader, his introversion and turbulence implies that he would have been less comfortable taking that position in the team, though would still have performed well in the role if required.
										The strategy of Constant Improvement can be a powerfully productive one when combined with confidence and knowledge of one’s own abilities, and it is plain to see that he knows what he is doing.
										These results suggest that William will be most comfortable in a role where he can get stuck in and do what he does best, produce quality work.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>Maritza Molina</h2>
									<p>
										A Diplomat with the Social Engagement strategy can be trusted to speak their mind and feel at home in social settings, caring deeply about the levels of communication within a group and more than prepared to reach out and make connections.
										With Maritza’s outstanding social confidence, she is the perfect choice for organising our IT professional interview and can be relied upon to be well involved in our meetings, keeping everyone up to date on her progress.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>James Falla</h2>
									<p>
										Sentinels are known for their confidence, co-operation, and grounded nature, working hard to maintain stability and steady progress, and carefully ensuring that all goes smoothly.
										That in combination with the Confident Individualism strategy paints a picture of someone who is self-motivated, efficient, and will fix anything he can when he sees the opportunity to do so.
										James has quickly proven himself to be a valuable member of the team, exhibiting these qualities and more.
										He knows his strengths and will use them wherever possible, doing what he can to ensure we get the job done.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="mbti_analysis">
									<h2>Stephen Lincoln</h2>
									<p>
										The Analyst role is one of logic and speculation, known for their thinking and occasional over-thinking.
										People of this type are sometimes seen as abrasive or unapproachable as they are not naturally inclined to surround themselves with others, a trait which can make it difficult to involve others when it is required.
										An Analyst with the Constant Improvement strategy may find themselves spending too much time considering approaches to a problem or task and having difficulty making their ideas a reality.
										Stephen will need to make a point of communicating with the group and ensuring that he materialises his plans or seeks guidance from others about how to proceed.
