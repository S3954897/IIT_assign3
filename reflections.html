								<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p>Reflecting as a whole, we were all really impressed with how the team came together to work on and create our vision for the My Bike Register solution. From Grant’s vision and continual hard work on the development, to William and Martiza’s planning of the timeline and overall plan and progress, each person within the group had their goals, their tasks and their ambitions to complete and all members of the team stepped up to the plate and achieved those goals. From the get go, we all pretty unanimously agreed that the way the team formed and divided tasks was much more efficient compared to assignment 2, with tasks broken down from a perspective of the overall project and also the tasks for the end result of the application. </p>
									<p>We could have certainly improved in our knowledge of the software that we proposed to use, with most of the team having very little knowledge in the software we ended up using, it did cause a strain on the team. Certain tasks had to be given to certain members to ensure that it was completed in a timely manner, however, that put a time constraint on other tasks that were reliant on the actual deliverable being created. </p>
									<p>All of us were certainly surprised by the end result we were able to pull together at the end, it's an incredible achievement to all involved and we are all really proud of what we created. As a group we all learnt about each other’s strengths and weaknesses, what each person would be good at completing, what areas we needed to improve or cover. We all have a greater understanding of what it truly means to work in a group, it's about pulling together and completing the task we were assigned with the resources we have. </p>
									<p>The Github log of activity does not actively reflect the work on our assignment as most drafts were handled via Teams and only migrated into the GitHub Repository towards the end of the Project, however, the GitHub logs do actively represent the body of work that team completed. </p>
								<h2>James' Reflection</h2>
									<p>Following on from Assignment 2, the group has maintained that momentum, no longer having issues with who is or isn’t in the group and contributing. Our team work was much better coordinated and the divided up of tasks was handled in a much more equitable way compared to assignment 2. The area we could improve on is communication, with many meetings going well over the expected time, and many of those meetings not coming to a conclusion on certain decisions that needed to be made in a timely manner. I was most surprised by how quickly the group adapted to working on a project that was well beyond the scope of our knowledge. I have learnt that working in groups is a challenging experience that requires a level head. The Github log of activity does not actively reflect the work on our assignment as most drafts were handled via Teams and only migrated into the GitHub Repository towards the end of the Project, however, the GitHub logs do actively represent the body of work that team completed. </p>
								<h2>Grant's Reflection</h2>
									<p>I have found assessment 3 and 5 a little more challenging as dividing the tasks necessary was more complex. James has really taken the lead on being very clear on the needs of the overall assessment requirements and was able to quickly break down the groups needs which allowed for quick distribution of the tasks. We have had some group member difficulties that we have overcome to produce a result that I am proud to submit. I am glad I had the opportunity to work with the members of team 5 and I wish them well in their futures, whatever that holds for them. As far as my own growth during this project I was able to expand on my own knowledge with the chosen tools to produce a artefact that 3 months ago I would not have known where to begin. This as a result has given me personal confidence to continue down my chosen path as a full stack developer with a mobile device flavor. I hope to expand on this knowledge and the project in question to see if I can make it a marketable product. </p>
