								<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p>As a group we came together and organised our time very efficiently, meetings were organised promptly and ran on time biweekly. There were issues early on with Team member’s leaving during the early stages of the group allocations and towards the end we unfortunately had one of the team members drop out, however, the greatest strength of our team was our resolve to get on with the work and complete the tasks at hand, with everyone picking up the slack where required.  </p>
									<p>Improvements could definitely be made to how the meetings were run, with many going over time. An agenda was used and the conversations were fruitful in that it helped build teamwork amongst the team, however, it also drew away the focus at times. Keeping a hard limit on the lengths of meetings could have helped avoid these issues in the future. </p>
									<p>The team overall was definitely surprised with how quickly we clicked together, roles were decided promptly, tasks were allocated and there was little to no bickering at any point. It’s not unusual to have teams formed that work well together, but given we were all strangers, the speed in which we were able to become a cohesive team was certainly surprising. </p>
									<p>As the days and weeks continued on during the project, the team developed and learnt many skills required for completing the tasks. Examples include; effective interviewing practices such as; proving the questions prior to the interview to allocating who would lead the questioning and when the others could interject with their own questions and comments. Not only were their improvements to our interviewing practices, but the writing or our reports and the research that went into it improved drastically, with the team coming together, bouncing ideas off of each other and assisting in reviewing and updating each piece of work that any team member had put forward for submission. </p>
									<p>Our team decided early on to use the collaborative function of Microsoft Teams to allow files to be uploaded to a Teams Channel where anyone was then able to view and modify the files. This allowed for a proactive reviewing system of the pieces of work that we were all completing, and a layered folder structure for effective organisation of those files. Having the meeting minutes and agenda kept in the same places as the work we were creating made it much easier for the team to quickly reference back and forth from. Unfortunately this meant a log of the GitHub logs came towards the later stages of the project, where the work we had created was then moved into the GitHub to be worked into the website we were creating. Despite that, the Github will demonstrate the sheer volume of work that we as a team completed and a clear log of how the final product came together. </p>
								<h2>Individual Reflection</h2>
									<p>Grant’s reflection - This has been a wonderful experience working with new people remotely on a variety of tasks with a host of new tools that I have not used before on subjects that I am not completely familiar. The team has been incredibly supportive, and the core members have also made significant contributions to the inevitable HD outcome of the assessment. The group has had trials during the assessment with one member dropping out without notification and a team member with personal issues that impacted their level of contribution to the team, but we have overcome these issues through clear understanding of the tasks that needed to be completed, acknowledgment of our individual strengths and the willingness maintain communication as a group and give their best to the work that was being completed. I enjoyed the meetings with the team. We kept them brief and concise and on point but still allowed everyone present to contribute equally and allowed a casual approach while maintaining the necessary formalities to meet the needs of the outcome. All points and suggestions from all the team members were considered and given weight, and I found that we all had complimentary personalities that allowed for the cooperation of the group.</p>
									<p>Maritza's Reflection - My first reaction to a group project on the second assessment seemed daunting at first. Questions about how you chose team-mates and the fear of being the last one picked raced through my mind. Thankfully, the reality has been quite the opposite of my fears. From the time Grant mentioned in the group chat in a tutorial he had created a team and jumping in, his leadership throughout this project has been a testament to completing this assignment. He has gone above and beyond with organising and meticulous record keeping ensuring we met and exceed the task brief. I truly appreciate all of Grant's effort to create a supportive environment. The allocations of tasks were handled fairly and took into consideration individual strengths. There were challenges faced within the team which were overcome by keeping an open line of communication with the core group members. There has been no shortage of support shown by the core team members and have felt supported when I've not felt my most confident. I have enjoyed interacting with everyone and getting to know each other through our conversations in meetings. I feel we've all had a similar approach with this assessment and have been able to work collectively to achieve a positive outcome.  </p>
									<p>William’s Reflection - I have to be honest, my dislike for working in groups is intense. I generally have a frightening preconception of horrific engagements with group members, work not being completed in a timely manner, and misunderstandings between group members. I am very happy to say that this has not been the case with the current group. On the contrary, the experience has been quite enjoyable, and I am looking forward to working on Assignment three with the same group. There has been a relatively large amount of work to complete, but I feel that we have done an exceptional job at arriving at the finished product. Group communication has been very satisfactory, and we have managed to stay ahead of the time constraints we have set for ourselves. The regular Team meetings have also been very helpful, in discussing potential issues, clearing up misunderstandings, and planning for the next section of work to be completed. This experience has shifted my perspective and my attitude to working in groups to the more positive side of the dial. </p>
									<p>James’ Reflection - Looking back at this assignment, it has been a great experience, meeting new people with different skill sets and different strengths and weaknesses has broadened my own personal knowledge and experience. The way tasks were handled via Kanban and allocated to each person, with differing timelines for each stage of the development of those sections was an amazing tool to keep the team on track and inevitably completing our assignment on time. As a team we could certainly have improved at the communication side of things, keeping other team members updates on progress especially if one of the meetings were missed. This led to certain tasks needing to be completed with further assistance from other team members to ensure it was of the expected quality. I was surprised by how effective Teams was for storing, and allowing for updates to all of our documents, this allowed us to see the documents being uploaded and easily reviewed and edited by the team without needing to reupload, I’ve learnt that groups can bring people of all different walks of life together, to work on and create an incredible project together, bringing their own personal flavour and touch to everything. We predominantly used Microsoft Teams to capture our documentation and progress on our work, moving it into Github in the later stages of development.  </p>
									<p>Stephen’s Reflection - As someone who tends to struggle with group settings, this was always going to be a challenge for me. The regular group meetings, in combination with the consistent proactive engagement others have had in this project resulted in everything coming together nicely in the end. Grant’s expert coordination as leader supported by the amount of effort and detail put in by the team has proved to be a powerfully effective group structure. In future I will need to make a point of pushing through mental barriers and updating group members of my situation and where I am at so that work can be coordinated efficiently and productively. I was surprised how understanding the group was when I could not perform to the same level as others; going forward I think I will have less trouble with communicating my difficulties in group settings. I would have liked if we had managed to set up a way for each of us to directly contribute to the GitHub repository so that I could learn more about how it works and what it is like to collaborate in such a way. Microsoft Teams has mostly been sufficient for the purposes of completing this group assignment. I really like this group and I hope that if we continue to work together that I will be able to contribute more during the next project. </p>
