								<p>Management of assignment 3â€™s work progress was more difficult than assignment 2 as there was a loss in personnel with this assignment so it fell on the shoulder of the remaining group members. To get the work done in the time allocated we divided the work between us and had regular meetings. Documentation was uploaded to the files section on Teams, Program for the artefact was uploaded to the github and the database was managed through clever cloud. With the increased workload the frequency of meetings was increased to 3 days per week for three reasons. One. To ensure we all had the information that was needed for the current section of work that was being delt with. Two. To ensure that we were progressing towards completion and three. To keep our morale up so we could keep focus on the successful completion.</p>
